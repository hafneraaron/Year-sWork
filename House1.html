		<section id="intro"> <!-- This creates the introduction. It is meant to preface the actual constitution and act as a sort of informal history lesson, giving the highlights of the Constitution -->
			<p>Here at H&G Real Estate, we value trust and transparency more than anything else. That is why we pair each and every customer with a handpicked realtor chosen for their empathy and good nature. And that is why we have constructed a new online floorplan for one of our finest homes.</p>
			<p>And although this home may be out of most people's price range, rest assured that we sell homes of every price. A new floorplan for a smaller, lower-budget home is under way, and should be available online by August 2019.</p>
			<p>For the timebeing, though, feel free to enjoy <i>this </i>floorplan. We pride ourselves on our attention to detail, and that is why we have described every room and major object in excruciating detail. This information can be seen to the left, and links to the other floors of this building can be seen to the right. </p>
