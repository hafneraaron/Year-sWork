			<p>This paragraph is the decendent of a section so it should have background-color red.</p>

				<p>Even though this p is in a div, that div is in a section so it is still a descendant of a section, so it should have background-color red.</p>

			<h1>This is my h1. It should be green because it is the child of a section</h1>
			<p>This p should be blue because it fallows h1.</p>
			<div>
				<h1>This is another h1, but it should not be green because it is inside a div inside a section, meaning it is not the child of a section.</h1>
			</div>
			<span>This is my span. It should be purple because it is a general sibling of an h1.</span>
